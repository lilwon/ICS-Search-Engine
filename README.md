Milestone 1: Index construction <br>
Milestone 2: Search Retrieval construction <br>
Milestone 3: Working Prototype of a Search Engine <br>


## Starting the Indexer 




The following files should be created from our indexer prior to starting the search engine:<br>

1.doc_id_map.txt

2. important_text_inverted.txt

3. imptext_offsets.txt

4.merged_index.txt

5. new_inverted_index.txt
 
6. partial_index_1.txt
 
7. partial_index_2.txt

8. partial_index_3.txt

9.word_offsets.txt
 



## Starting up the Search Engine
**Only do this if it's necessary** <br>
Follow the [Flask installation page](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/) 
to set up and activate the envrionment, then install Flask. <br> 

To start the search engine, enter 
`py -3 webgui.py`
on your command prompt or terminal. 

After everything has finished loading, you can now access the web site through your browser with the following url: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
