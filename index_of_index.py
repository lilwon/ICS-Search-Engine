'''
    Index of the inverted index. 

    After the inverted index is merged/finalized. You would need to create another bookkeeping file 
    (possibly just another dictionary) that only contains the WORD and the position of the 
    word from the inverted index.

def index_of_inverted_index():
    new_index = {} # index that would return WORD @ position

    # get the inverted_index file 
    


    # return new_index
